Nodes
```

sum(label_replace(label_replace(hofund_connection_status, "title", "$1", "target","(.+)"), "id", "$1", "title", "(.+)")) without (source, target, instance, job, type) or
sum(label_replace(label_replace(hofund_info_status, "title", "$1", "application_name","(.+)"), "subtitle", "$1", "application_version", "(.+)")) without (application_name, application_version, instance, job)

```

Edges
```
sum(label_replace(hofund_connection_status, "title", "$1", "target","(.+)")) without (source, target, instance, job, type)
```

nodes from last 7 days:
```text
sum(0 * sum_over_time(hofund_node[7d])) by (id, title, subtitle, type)
```

% of time when node was up
```text
sum(avg_over_time(( sum without() (hofund_info) or (0 * sum_over_time(hofund_info[7d])) )[7d:5m])) by (id)
```

Current state of nodes:
```text
sum(sum without() (hofund_info) or (0 * sum_over_time(hofund_info[7d]))) by (id)
